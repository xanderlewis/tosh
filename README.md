# tosh &mdash; a very simple shell

tosh / (tɒʃ) / noun. *slang, mainly British* nonsense; rubbish.

A very simple shell written for fun (and learning) in C, initially heavily following Stephen Brennan's nice blog post [here](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

## Usage
(Compile and) invoke however you like: from your preferred shell as `./tosh`, or run it on its own (like a *proper* shell!) with `exec ./tosh` (which is a builtin wrapper for the `exec()` system call that most shells seem to have).
