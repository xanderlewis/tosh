# TODO
- [x] add: `-v` verbose option for shell (off by default)
- [ ] add: quoting in arguments
- [ ] add: reading from config file at startup
- [ ] add: reading from config on builtin command
- [x] *silly, but..* make it look more fancy (somehow).
- [x] add: prompt that includes working directory (look up some number of levels)
- [x] add: expansion of `~` into `HOME` environment variable
- [x] add: filename globbing (pattern matching with `*` and `?`)
- [x] add: invocation of `cd` without arguments
- [x] fix: infinite loop on EOF
- [x] fix: memory leak that happens when expanding arguments
- [ ] add: up arrow gives history
- [x] add: variable number of levels in cwd path in prompt
- [x] add: sync global shell options/variables with environment variables
- [x] extract path expansion logic from argument parsing function; allow it to be used in parsing of other paths
- [ ] add: pipes!
- [ ] add: I/O redirection
- [ ] add: tab completion
- [ ] add: filename completion in current working directory
- [x] add: rainbow path (add an extra flag for this in the prompt string)
- [x] add: inline command substitution ((potentially recursive) execution in a subshell)
- [x] fix: silly segfault when getting close to root directory
- [x] fix: memory leak relating to globfree() and args pointers
- [x] add: take a file as an argument (not just into stdin)
- [x] fix: bug where things after `*` get dropped
- [x] add: ignore `#` comments
- [x] fix: 'non-allocated pointer being freed' error when running `cd`
- [ ] fix: / showing at beginning of path when it shouldn't
- [ ] add: make `<Ctrl-C>` send a SIGINT to the child process, rather than tosh itself (we can use `<Ctrl-D` to exit tosh anyway, because this will send it an EOF, or just use the 'quit' builtin.)
- [x] redo command parsing logic to handle mixture of spaces and brackets (and while we're at it, quotes). (this is very important for substitution).
- [ ] add: environment variable substitution
